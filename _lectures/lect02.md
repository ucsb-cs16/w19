# Code from lecture

# Topics

## Git
* Basics - organization, repos
* Using github's web interface
	* creating a repo
	* adding files to the repo
	* adding collaborators to the repo
	* updating files and viewing the version history
* Show command line usage - but won't go into too much detail

## Learn multiple important topics using a game of fizzbuzz

* Simple input/output with cin, cout
* Just fizz (using cin to get input, C++ variables)
* The full game (nested and multiway if-else, boolean expressions)
* Create the usage: ./fizzbuzz <number> (passing command line arguments)
* Fizzbuzz in a loop (for loops), get loop limit from command line 


## Simple flow control structures- For and while loops
* If else statements are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* Nested and multi-way if-else

## C++ variables and datatypes (contd)
* Scope and lifetime of variables
* Uninitialized variables in C++
* We will look at three specific datatypes: char, int and string
* Evaluating C++ expressions
* lvalue and rvalue
* Boolean expressions

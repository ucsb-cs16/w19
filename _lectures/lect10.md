# Topics

## Code from lecture
## Pointers

* Pointer declaration - difference/similarities with declaring basic types
* Accessing variables "indirectly" via pointers
* The address and indirection operators: "&" and "*"
* Pointers and arrays - similarities and dfferences
* Passing arrays to functions - specifically looking at how arrays degnerate to pointers on function calls.


## Pointers and structs
* Declaring structs
* Different ways of accessing member variables of a structs
* Pointers to structs, why and when to use them?
* Passing structs to functions by value, by reference and by address
* Pointer pitfalls


## C++ References
* Creating aliases with references
* Differences between references and pointers
* Constant pointers and references, when and why to use them


## Mechanics of function calls with specific attention to call by reference
* Program layout: text, data, bss, stack and heap
* References as function formal arguments
* More on the run-time stack

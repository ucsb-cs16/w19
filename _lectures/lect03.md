# Topics

## Github intro
* What is github? How and why we plan to use it in this class
* What is a git repo?
* Creating a github repo and using github's web interface to store your first program

* Intro to lab01
* For loops are DIFFERENT in C++ than in Python. We'll discuss.
* Simple accumulator
* For loops, applied to a simple accumulator pattern (find sum of a series)
* Basic abstraction in software: functions
* Function declaration, definition, and call
* Formal and actual parameters, return type


* Gentle intro to github: what is a repo, creating a repo,  cloning a repo to a local machine, syncing repos with git add, commit and push

Software developers almost always prefer to use github's command line tools for version control instead of the web interface. The reason is that with the command-line tools you can (1) use your favorite editor to write your code, instead of github's simple web-based editor (2) compile and test your code, while also performing version control.

* Read the articles on [creating a github repo under an organization](https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/), [cloning your first repo](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_cloning_your_first_repo/) and [git basic workflow](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_basic_workflow/).  We will now put the concepts from all the articles that you have read so far into practice. You may need to refer back to these articles to complete the following steps.

    <b>Boyuan Feng (TA)</b>
    <i> "Hi! I’m Boyuan, a first year graduate student in CS department. It’s my pleasure to be your TA this quarter. In CS16, you can learn basic knowledge for C++, which is one of the most important programming language. If we describe operating system, compiler, database, and network as wheels, C++ is the material and skill that you can use to re-invent wheels. Through understanding how C++ works, you can gain a deep understanding of computer science and a solid fundament for the upper level courses. If you have any questions about computer science or college experience, please feel free to send email to me at boyuan@umail.ucsb.edu. " </i>

This class gives you deeper knowledge of computer science world and guides you to be a great programmer. I hope all of you will enjoy it. Outside the class I would be happy to share and discuss with you everything related to computer science studies, advice on programming, careers or research, etc. Feel free to contact me on Piazza" </i>

I'm hoping this class will help you gain confidence with programming and a deeper understanding of programming concepts. I'm a third year, and am part of the UCSB Data Science club. Outside of school I enjoy playing board games and watching movies with my 9 housemates in Isla Vista, and sometimes going on runs or trying yoga classes. Last summer I was able to intern at InTouch Health, a local telehealth company. Feel free to reach out to me about classes, data science, statistics, or general advice. Contact me on Piazza " </i>

This my second quarter as a tutor at UCSB and I look forward to learning about becoming a better tutor and developing some relationships with everyone. Outside of class, my hobbies include gaming, playing and watching basketball (Warriors fan) and watching T.V. shows. You can also come talk to me about future class schedules, professors and the like since I’m a third year who has most likely taken the classes you are planning on taking! Feel free to reach me on Piazza :).

  <i> "Hey y’all, Ben here. I’’m a fourth-year CS major and I also tutored CS 8 last quarter like some of my fellow colleagues. I love teaching and I love learning, so hopefully we can learn a lot from each other this quarter! Outside of school, I love video games, and basketball. I’m a Spurs fan and always be down to play when I’m free, so hit me up! After graduating, I hope to work as a game developer, so if you have any questions or sick game ideas and need some help, come chat with me. But, you can always come talk to me about anything, whether it’s advice or just a friendly conversation, I’ll always be around! You can also reach me on Piazza if you aren’t able to find me in person for whatever reason. I am excited to be mentoring y’all this quarter and shoutouts to my mentor group, we’re gonna have lots of fun!

  <b> Barbara Korycki (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Barbara but my friends call me Barbs, or the occasional Babs. I’m a third year CS major and have been tutoring since last winter. As an intro-level course, CS16 is interesting to tutor because of the diversity in the students’ backgrounds, course-goals, majors, interests, etc. So this quarter I would like to focus on individualizing my approach in guiding my mentees; help P/NP non-majors grasp the basic foundational concepts, advise those who feel lost/confused/inadequate in their place in engineering (we’ve all been there), and challenge students who are more experienced and would like to take the course material to a more in-depth level. I also just came back from a semester abroad in Copenhagen if you would like advice on studying abroad as an engineer! 
Feel free to reach out whenever over Piazza  :-)

  <b>  Madhu Kannan (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Madhu, and I’m so excited to see all of you this quarter! I’m a third year CS/English double major, and I tutored CS 8 last quarter. I am also the secretary for Engineering Student Council, the student group that plans events for CoE undergraduates. CS 16 was the first class I ever took at UCSB, and it was fundamental to helping me understand what programming was and how I was going to use it for the next four years of my time here. I hope that I can help all of you come to that understanding as well, and leave this class feeling confident about you and your skills. In my spare time, I love reading books and binge-watching TV shows with my friends. (Who doesn't?) If you ever need advice on anything - from class assignments, to planning your courses, or even just a sympathetic ear if you’re having a hard time - you can always reach me on Piazza. :)

  <b> Yossi Hertzberg (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is Joseph, but everyone has always called me by my nickname, Yossi. I am a third year CS major and I am very excited to be one of your tutors for CS16. I worked as a tutor in high school as well, and I loved finding ways to make some of the same topics that I struggled with in a class less confusing for the next generation. I took CS16 during my freshman year here, so I hope to be able to help in this same way. I actually started at UCSB as a Mechanical Engineering major but found (eventually) that CS was much better for me, so I can help with many questions regarding major switching, especially into the CS department. Also, I love helping people see how to approach problems algorithmically in a way that a computer can understand, as this knowledge will help in all CS classes, and in any programming language. Outside of school, I love surfing, mountain biking, and playing with my two dogs. 
Please do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions on Piazza.

C++ can be intimidating so I hope that you all become comfortable with the language during the course of this class CS16.  I spent the fall studying abroad in Hong Kong at Hong Kong University of Science of technology and I also switched into CS from a non-engineering major so if you have questions either of those processes feel free ask! Outside of school I am active in my fraternity, I like to play basketball and soccer and like to hike. Feel free to email me at zakarybliss@umail.ucsb.edu if you have any questions.

  <b> Vincent La (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hello! My name is Vincent (but you can call me Vince) and I am looking forward to being your CS16 tutor. I enjoy teaching people new subjects, especially something as daunting as C++. In a world where computers become more important with every passing day, I think it is important that we understand how they work--and it’s even better if you can figure out how to talk to one. In addition to C++, I can also help with the other challenges of being a student--like how to work up the nerve to talk to those scary professors. Outside of school, I enjoy hiking, running, and following sports (mainly football and basketball). Lastly, feel free to email me at vincela9@gmail.com if you have any questions. You may occasionally catch me at a local coffee shop or in CSIL.

  <i> "Hello! I’m Dana, and I’m a third-year computer science student. I’m excited to be working with some of you in CS16. Because CS16 is a foundation computer science course, some topics can be challenging at first (I know it was for me!), but I’m here to help you get through it! Not only do I want to help you succeed in CS16, I also want to be a resource for you in terms of your CS pathway/career. In addition to being a CS student, I’m a researcher in the CS department and a past software engineer intern at NASA Ames Research Center. Outside of class, I love playing the ukulele and calligraphy.  If you have any questions about researching or internships or want advice in general, feel free to reach out with me at dananguyen@ucsb.edu. I look forward to meeting you! " </i>

  <i> "Salutations and welcome to CS 16. In the next nine weeks we will both be learning something new: I will be tutoring CS 16 for the first time, and you all will be taking CS 16. I hope we can work together, and get as much computer science knowledge into our brains as possible. Currently I’m a third year CCS CS student, also enrolled in the MS/BS program. I’m the Treasurer for the Society of Women Engineers (S.W.E) and would love to recruit some new computer scientists! This coming summer and last summer, I interned as a Software Engineer at Microsoft.

Read Chapter 4, sections 4.1 - 4.3.
Please note that while the book does not cover number representation, it is an important concept for this class. Questions 3 to  are meant to give you more practice with number representation. Please turn in the physical copy of your homework in person. Write in PEN or DARK PENCIL.

<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">
1.  (2 pts) What is a flag in a program and of what use is it?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

2.  (2 pts) What is type casting and how is it performed in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.(5 pts) Which of these uses of type casting will NOT ensure that f is 1.5? Answer should be (ex1), (ex2), (ex3), or (ex4) (or a combination of those).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a(1), b(2), c(2), d(2), e(2);
double f;

f = (a + b)*c / static_cast<double>(d + e); // (ex1)
f = static_cast<double>(a + b)*c / (d + e); // (ex2)
f = (a + b)*static_cast<double>(c) / (d + e); // (ex3)
f = static_cast<double>((a + b)*(c) / (d + e)); // (ex4)
```
</div>

  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4.(3 pts) We talked about three concepts that are very important to keep straight, and not confuse: (a) function declaration, (b) function definition, and (c) function call. Here is a short C++ program, with line numbers. Please indicate after the program which line number (or range of line numbers, e.g. 3-5 or 7-14) contains the function prototype, function definition, and function call for the isDivisibleBy function.
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
1  #include <iostream>
2  using namespace std;
3
4  bool isDivisibleBy(int a, int b);
5
6  int main() {
7     cout << "result for (15,5) is " << isDivisibleBy(5,15) << endl;
8     cout << "result for (15,5) is " << isDivisibleBy(5,15) << endl;
9     return 0;
10  }
11
12  bool isDivisibleBy(int a, int b) {
13    return ( a % b == 0 );
14  }
```
</div>



5.(8 pts) Write a function declaration and a function definition for a function that takes one argument of type int and one argument of type double, and that returns a value of type double that is the average of the two arguments?
  <div style="margin-bottom:20em"></div>

  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.  (10 pts) Write a function named 'check_descending' that takes three arguments of type int and returns true if the arguments are in descending order; otherwise, it returns false. You can use any type of C++ statements that we've gone over in class so far to accomplish this goal.
  <div style="margin-bottom:30em"></div>

7. (6 pts) The infinite series: s = 1 + (2/3) + (4/9) + (8/27) + .... is a geometric series that converges to a whole rational number (i.e. like 2 or 3 or 4). Below is an unfinished C++ program that will calculate s to the kth position (so, for example, if k = 1, then s = 1 + (2/3) = 1.666...). Fill in the missing code:
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

  <div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    double s(0.0);
    int k(0);
    cout << "Enter k: ";
    cin >> k;
    for (____________________________________________________) {

        s = ____________________________________________________; }

    cout << "Series converges to: " << s << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
  </div>

8. (8 pts) Compile and run the above completed program. What is the value of s if k = 6? if k = 19 ? What whole rational number does s look like it's approaching? What is the smallest value of k for s to be shown by the program as exactly equal to that whole number?

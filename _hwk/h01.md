2. (1 pt) What is the size of the smallest data item in main memory that has a memory address? You may provide your answer in bits or bytes.

3.	(5 pts) The book talks about the five important hardware components of a computer  i) input devices ii) output devices iii) processor iv) main memory and v) secondary memory. It also talks about two important pieces of software: compilers and operating systems. Which of the above is primarily responsible for each of the following tasks? Write 'none' if none of the options apply.

	i. Converts a program from a high-level language to machine language.
	<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
	ii. Executes a program stored in main memory.
	<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
	iii. Allocates the computer's resources to the different tasks that the computer must accomplish.  
	<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
	iv. Stores a program while it is being executed.
	<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
	v. Converts a program from one high-level language to another high-level language.

4. (2 pts) Not including any comments that may appear, what are the first two lines that typically begin a C++ program that is going to either output on the screen, and/or read input from the keyboard?

5. (4 pts) As you discovered when you read the textbook, for the most basic kind of input and output, C++ uses two words, and two symbols, along with variables and quoted strings. Unlike in some other languages (e.g. Python), quoted strings must always use double quote marks `"like this"`, never single quotes `'like this'`.  (Single quotes are used for another purpose in C++.)  Inside a quoted string, `\n` means "newline". Quoted strings can only be output, while the value of a variable can be either output to the screen, or read in from the keyboard.  Variable names are not put inside quotation marks. Also remember that every line of C++ that does input or output <strong>must end in a semicolon</strong>.
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
Assuming the variable `int age;` has already been declared and initialized with a value, write a C++ statement that will print out `My age is: ` followed by the value of the variable `age`, followed by a newline?. (For full credit, be sure to end your line with a semicolon.)
	<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>


6.  (4 pts) The textbook describes C++11 on p.27.  Briefly, what is C++11? (A one sentence answer is good enough.  Note that if your textbook doesn't describe C++11 on p. 27, then you may have the wrong edition.  You need the ninth or tenth edition.)
